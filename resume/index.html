                    I established rock-solid foundations for software
                    development methodologies within our teams. I
                    significantly enhanced our expertise in Go and Python. I

                    I initiated and implemented the &ldquo;infrastructure as code&rdquo;

                    subscription processes for the Apple App Store using the
                    Go language. I implemented template services and libraries

                    we will develop in the future.
